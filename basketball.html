    Our basketball exercises focus on three main components: vertical jump,
    shooting, and handling. All three parts coincide with each other and work in
    tandem. We will dive into four exercises per part.

      If you can't put the ball in the hoop, then you will not play another game
      of basketball in your life. There isn't many weight-related exercises that
      exist for training. Because of that, most of these practices will be
      game-related activities. Its just like the saying, practice makes perfect.

    <h1 id="thirdtop">Handling</h1>
    <p id="thirdhead">
      Personally, I could never play the sport of basketball because of how bad
      my handling of the ball is. Having good handling, however, could be the
      descision between a win or a loss. Just think about it: down 1 with 10
      seconds left with your possesion. You're driving down the court, then bam.
      The ball gets stolen and the game is over.
