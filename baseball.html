    Our baseball exercises focus on three main components: bat speed,
    acceleration, and plate recognition. All three parts coincide with eachother
    and work in tandem. We will dive into four exercises per part.

  <div class="firstsection">
    <h1 id="firsttop">Bat Speed</h1>
    <p id="firsthead">
      The Atlanta Braves had a team slugging percentage of 0.501, which is the
      highest of all time for one team. They also had the home run and RBI
      leader, Matt Olsen, the NL MVP, Ronald Acu√±a Jr, and the second most home
      runs by a team in history. This does come down to mechanics up at the
      plate, but in the end, you're never going to hit home runs without the
      proper bat speed in your swing. Our bat speed training will utilize lots
      of calistenics, with weights as well.

    <p id="secondhead">
      You are never going to succeed on offense if you cannot recognize pitches
      and pitch locations at the plate. Although at first thought you may think
      that this is only trained by trial and error, however, it is actually
      quite easy to work on. There will be less physical activity at play and
      more mental work with color-differentiation, speed work, and more.

        The Cincinnati Reds led the league with 190 stolen bases, nearly
        quadrupling their 58 of last year, with stars Elly De La Cruz, Will
        Benson, amd TJ Friedl leading the charge. The acceleration from 0-18+
        miles per hour is one of the most crucial parts of base stealing, which
        also helps with extra base hits and fielding.
